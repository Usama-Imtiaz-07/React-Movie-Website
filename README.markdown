# Movie Database App

## Overview
Movie Database App is a dynamic, single-page web application built with **React.js**, showcasing my expertise in modern frontend development for a full stack portfolio. Integrated with the **TMDB API**, this app enables users to browse movies, search for specific titles, manage a favorites list, and explore trending movies via an interactive carousel. Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive, polished UI, it leverages **React Router** for seamless navigation and **React Context API** for efficient state management. A trailer playback feature, routing to a dedicated page, is currently in development, demonstrating my ability to build scalable, API-driven applications.
