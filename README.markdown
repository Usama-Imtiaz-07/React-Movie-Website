# Movie Database App

## Overview
Movie Database App is a dynamic, single-page web application built with **React.js**, showcasing my skills in modern frontend development. Integrated with the **TMDB API**, this project enables users to explore trending movies, manage a favorites list, and navigate a responsive UI with seamless page routing. Styled with **Tailwind CSS** and enhanced with features like a trending movie carousel and an in-development trailer playback system, this app demonstrates my ability to build engaging, API-driven applications suitable for a full stack portfolio.
